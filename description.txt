Lets you reduce dust.

Provides a config setting for the percentage of dust erased, and a whitelist/blacklist for dust types.

This mod uses IL editing, so it might have compatibility issues with other mods that edit Terraria.Dust.NewDust (if you don't have any issues, don't worry about it).

Planned functionality:
Improved UI

Changelog:
Added Whitelist/Blacklist for certain dust types
Now allows user to only cull a certain percentage of dust
