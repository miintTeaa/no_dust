Turns off dust.

Includes a single setting, where you can enable or disable this functionality without having to reload anything.

This mod uses IL editing, so it might have compatibility issues with other mods that edit Terraria.Dust.NewDust (if you don't have any issues, don't worry about it).

Planned functionality:
Whitelist/Blacklist for certain dust types
Allow user to only cull a certain percentage of dust

Changelog:
Updated icon
